# 🚀 Contributing to SiteScan-EmailExtractor-Python-CLI

Thank you for considering contributing to **SiteScan-EmailExtractor-Python-CLI**! We welcome your contributions to help improve this powerful Python CLI tool for extracting emails and URLs from websites.

## 1. Our Guiding Principles

This project adheres to the **Apex Technical Authority** standards, prioritizing:

*   **Zero-Defect:** Aim for high quality and minimal bugs.
*   **High-Velocity:** Streamline development and contribution processes.
*   **Future-Proof:** Build with maintainability and scalability in mind.
*   **Professionalism:** Maintain a clean, well-documented, and robust codebase.

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python:** Version 3.10+ (as per Apex standards for Python projects).
*   **uv:** The recommended package manager for Python. If you don't have it, install it via pip: `pip install uv`.
*   **Git:** For version control.

### 2.2 Setup

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the repository on GitHub.
    `https://github.com/chirag127/SiteScan-EmailExtractor-Python-CLI/fork`

2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/chirag127/SiteScan-EmailExtractor-Python-CLI.git
    cd SiteScan-EmailExtractor-Python-CLI
    

3.  **Set Upstream Remote:** Configure your local repository to track the original `chirag127` repository.
    bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/chirag127/SiteScan-EmailExtractor-Python-CLI.git
    

4.  **Install Dependencies:** Use `uv` to install project dependencies and set up the development environment.
    bash
    uv venv  # Creates a virtual environment
    uv pip install -e "[dev]" # Installs project in editable mode with dev dependencies
    # OR if you prefer a clean install into the venv:
    # uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    # uv pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    

## 3. Development Workflow

Follow these steps for making changes:

1.  **Create a New Branch:** Always work on a new, descriptive branch for your feature or bug fix.
    bash
    git checkout -b my-new-feature
    # or for a bug fix:
    # git checkout -b fix/bug-description
    

2.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your code, adhering to the project's coding standards and architectural patterns.

3.  **Test Your Changes:** Ensure your changes are well-tested. Run the test suite using `pytest`.
    bash
    pytest
    
    Aim for comprehensive test coverage.

4.  **Lint and Format:** Ensure your code adheres to our linting and formatting standards using Ruff.
    bash
    ruff check .
    ruff format .
    
    Your code should pass these checks without errors or warnings.

5.  **Commit Your Changes:** Make clear, concise, and atomic commits.
    bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add recursive crawling depth option"
    # or for a bug fix:
    # git commit -m "fix: Resolve issue with malformed URLs during parsing"
    

6.  **Push Your Branch:** Push your changes to your fork.
    bash
    git push origin my-new-feature
    

7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):** Create a PR from your branch to the `main` branch of the `chirag127/SiteScan-EmailExtractor-Python-CLI` repository.

## 4. Contribution Guidelines

*   **Code Style:** Adhere to PEP 8 standards, with Ruff enforcing specific configurations.
*   **Testing:** All new features must include corresponding unit or integration tests. Bug fixes should include tests that reproduce the bug.
*   **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation (e.g., README, docstrings) for any significant changes.
*   **Pull Requests:**
    *   Keep PRs focused on a single feature or bug fix.
    *   Provide a clear description of your changes and the problem they solve.
    *   Respond promptly to review feedback.
*   **Commit Messages:** Follow the Conventional Commits specification (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`).

## 5. Architectural Principles (Apex Standards)

*   **Modularity:** Design components for reusability and separation of concerns.
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid redundant code.
*   **SOLID Principles:** Adhere to the SOLID principles where applicable.
*   **Pythonic Code:** Write idiomatic Python.

## 6. Reporting Issues

*   A clear, descriptive title.
*   The version of the tool you are using.
*   Steps to reproduce the bug.
*   Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.
*   Any relevant error messages or logs.
*   The environment (OS, Python version).

## 7. Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please refer to the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file for details (Note: This file is not generated by this tool but is a standard part of professional repositories).
